Content Theory is a blog about coding and philosophy. I have found that the more coding I do, the more I learn about the relationship between man and machine, which in some respects defines the nature of our world.

But also, dorking out on code samples is no way to attract an audience. So...philosophy. Yeah, that'll have them lined up for blocks.
