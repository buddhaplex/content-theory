I am lucky enough to be working along-side several extremely talented technologists, which is partially what inspired me to dive more deeply into coding myself. As I started to tell them about the fact that I was going to get my hands dirty with development, they have all said to me at one point or another (without fail): "Get a passion project, and you'll learn a lot faster." This seems to also be a very commonly held belief in the community.
<br /><br />
So, I've got two.

* This blog. I'm committing to chronicling the things I learn as I work on my coding skills. As I build things, I will share them. Even if I think they suck. Because honestly, those things are going to teach me a lot about writing better code, and maybe lead to better ideas over the long haul. And as I get better, and more knowledgeable, I'm hoping that what I learn can be used to help others build great software. Because if there's one thing I know for sure: nothing worth doing is easy, and it's always a lot more fun (and generally successful) when you do it with a team.

* My passion projects:

Building a couple of applications that will help me do my current job(s) better (which I'll explain as I progress), and one or two apps that I have ideas for that I think may be fun, useful, and possibly make a solid contribution to the world.
<br /><br />
I'm doing these all primarily for my own edification and skills development. I'm a guy that has a deep background in integrated communications. I've created a lot of very cool tech with a lot of very talented developers over the course of my career so far, and I've learned a lot about how to design and build these solutions. But as I continue to refine my coding skills, I realize that some of what I learned was done vicariously. Solving the challenges you're pushing through at the level of code is an altogether different challenge. And I'm glad I've taken that up, and look forward to seeing what I can build!
<br /><br />
For now, back to coding.
