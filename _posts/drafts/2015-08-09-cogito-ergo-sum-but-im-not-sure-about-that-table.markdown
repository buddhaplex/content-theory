Points to make:
- B. Russell - arguments and what philosophy can facilitate in the way of proving things exist.
- TDD - bring them into existence prior to their existing, by planning their functions, which then define them as objects.
- Discussion about the gems and tools that handle "magic", and how as a beginning developer, it's difficult to know what errors are real/need handling, and which can be left alone (apart from errors that make failure). It's my intention to learn to code cleanly and correctly, without errors. And learning TDD is like giving you that instruction to leave the place cleaner than when you got it. Or, always clean up after the work is done.
- RubyMonk, Well Grounded Rubyist, Understanding Computation, Podcasts, etc. Things to learn are not in short supply. Understanding what to focus on is not self-evident. Jumping right in and seeing how the water feels is the way to do it. The table may not be there when you want to depend on it.
